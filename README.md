This repository accompanies the paper "Volumetric and Surface Characteristics of Gray Matter in Adult Dyslexia and Dyscalculia". Files include:
- gyrif.png: flat map showing bayes Factors 01 from the cortical gyrification analysis (contrasts all groups with one another)
- gyrif_inflated: same as above, but inflated brain map
- sulcus.png: flat map showing bayes Factors 01 from the cortical sulcal depth analysis (contrasts all groups with one another)
- sulc_inflated: same as above, but inflated brain map
- thickness.png: flat map showing bayes Factors 01 from the cortical thickness analysis (contrasts all groups with one another)
- thickness_inflated: same as above, but inflated brain map
- volume.png: flat map showing bayes Factors 01 from the cortical volume analysis (contrasts all groups with one another)
- volume_brain.png: same as above, but inflated brain map
