This repository accompanies the paper "Volumetric and Surface Characteristics of Gray Matter in Adult Dyslexia and Dyscalculia". Files include:

- 01_XX - 12_XX: Preprocessing and analysis scripts
- gyrification_BF01.png: inflated brain map showing Bayes Factors 01 from the gyrification analysis (contrasts all groups with one another)
- gyrification_BF01_flatmap.png: same as above, but flatmap
- sulcal-depth_BF01.png: inflated brain map showing Bayes Factors 01 from the sulcal depth analysis (contrasts all groups with one another)
- sulcal-depth_BF01_flatmap.png: same as above, but flatmap
- thickness_BF01.png: inflated brain map showing Bayes Factors 01 from the cortical thickness analysis (contrasts all groups with one another)
