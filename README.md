This repository accompanies the paper "Volumetric and Surface Characteristics of Gray Matter in Adult Dyslexia and Dyscalculia". Files include:

- 01_XX.mat - 12_XX.mat: preprocessing and analysis scripts
- gyrification_BF01.png: inflated brain map showing Bayes Factors 01 from the gyrification analysis (contrasts all groups with one another)
- gyrification_BF01_flatmap.png: same as above, but flatmap
- sulcal-depth_BF01.png: inflated brain map showing Bayes Factors 01 from the sulcal depth analysis (contrasts all groups with one another)
- sulcal-depth_BF01_flatmap.png: same as above, but flatmap
- thickness_BF01.png: inflated brain map showing Bayes Factors 01 from the cortical thickness analysis (contrasts all groups with one another)
- thickness_BF01_flatmap.png: same as above, but flatmap
- volume_BF01.png: brain map showing Bayes Factors 01 from the gray matter volume analysis (contrasts all groups with one another)
- volume_BF01_flatmap.png: same as above, but flatmap
- behavioral_measures.png: violin and box plots for all behavioral measures, broken down by group
- quality_control.csv: weighted average for preprocessing and image quality, for all subjects
- IQR_plot.png: quality rating for all analyses, plotted by group.
